Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification

In this project I attempt to implement various approaches to classify sentences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
Though I was not successful in implementing my desired model, the model I ultimately employed got better accuracy than was 
originally hoped for. I conclude with thoughts on possible directions for future projects.
